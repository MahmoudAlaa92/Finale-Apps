# Restaurant Menu App

## Overview
- This project is an interactive restaurant menu app developed in Swift. The app allows users to view a list of available menu items, add selected items to their order, and submit the order to the restaurant. The menu, item descriptions, and images are retrieved and updated dynamically from a web service API.

## Key Features:
Menu Viewing: Users can browse through a list of menu items, complete with descriptions and images.
Order Creation: Users can select items from the menu and add them to their order.
Order Submission: Once an order is complete, users can submit their order to the restaurant.
Server Interaction: The app communicates with a server (run locally) to fetch and update menu data such as item details and images.

## Technologies Used:
- Swift: Core programming language used to build the app.
- UIKit: Framework for building the appâ€™s user interface.
- Web Service API: For fetching and updating menu data.
- URLSession: To handle API requests and retrieve data from the server.
  
This project demonstrates how to integrate web services into an iOS app, handle dynamic data, and provide a smooth user experience for viewing and submitting orders.
